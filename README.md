Graffiti Trend Analysis based on 311 Service Requests Data

This is a project done as a Fellow in The Data Incubator. The motivation and work done for this project is entirely my own. The program provided me the skills needed to complete this project.

Here we have some preliminary analysis of the 311 Service Request Data to understand how much graffiti complaint comes in. Once I decided to focus specifically in Brooklyn, I did more exploratory analysis and lots of visualizations to understand the patterns comparing total graffiti reports, average resolution time, and change in residential property value. Then I created a simple linear regression model to predict the total graffiti reports for each month in 2019.

During the project, I found that there are too many variables that can mediate the graffiti complaint that goes through 311 and the relationship between graffiti reports and property value. As a result, I only made a simple prediction model and will continue to look for other sources to produce a more meaningful prediction.
